         * Test if GitHub is working for you:
         * Add a new C# Script in the Scripts folder called "GitHubTestYourName"
         * Save changes and exit Unity
         * Go to GitHub Desktop and click Fetch origin at the top
         * If any changes have been done by others, the button will change to Pull origin. Click this
         ******************************************************************************************************
         NOTE: If someone has been editing the same file at the same time you have and has already uploaded
         their changes, an error will pop up and you will have to click "Stash changes and continue". Once
         GitHub finishes pulling the origin, you can now click "View stash" and "Restore".
         ******************************************************************************************************
         ******************************************************************************************************
         NOTE 2: If someone has edited the exact same line(s) of code that you have been working on, a merge
         conflict will occur. You will then have to go through each file and determine where the conflicts are
         and either edit your file to incorporate both changes (i.e. move your code down a few lines) or just 
         choose one file to upload (i.e. one person's changes will not be saved). In order to avoid this, it's 
         best if only one person makes changes to a file at a time.
         ******************************************************************************************************
         * In the summary field, put "GitHub Test" with your name
         * Click Commit to main
         * Click Push to origin at the top
         * Ask someone else to Fetch and Pull Origin and verify that they can now see the file you added
         * Finished! Follow this same process anytime you make a change or add/delete anything in the project
