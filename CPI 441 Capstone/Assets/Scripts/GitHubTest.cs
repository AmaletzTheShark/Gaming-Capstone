         * Test if GitHub is working for you:
         * Add your name to the below comments and save the project
         * Go to GitHub Desktop and you should see your changed files to the left
         * If any changes have been done by others, the button will change to Pull origin. Click this
         *****************************************************************************************************
         NOTE: If someone has been editing the same file at the same time you have and has already uploaded
         their changes, an error will pop up and you will have to click "Stash changes and continue". Once
         GitHub finishes pulling the origin, you can now click "View stash" and "Restore".
         *****************************************************************************************************
         * In the summary field, put "GitHub Test" with your name
         * Click Commit to main
         * Click Push to origin at the top
         * Ask someone else to Fetch and Pull Origin and verify that they can now see your name in the comments
         * Testing fetch origin
         * Finished! Follow this same process anytime you make a change or add/delete anything in the project
